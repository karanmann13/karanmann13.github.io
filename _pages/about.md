I am an Applied Mathematics student at Simon Fraser University with interests in machine learning and data science. I hope to pursue a PhD in this field, eventually. Another interest of mine is sports, and sports performance. A lot of my time is devoted to watching soccer, basketball and football -- trying to understand what makes a great sportsman great. I built a forty-yard dash predictive model using polynomial regression and it was pretty accurate (although, I am not a big fan of physical measurements as metrics for good sporting ability)! I played soccer all my life until I tore my patellar tendon, and have been on hiatus for the last five years. My dream is to get back in shape and pursue a professional soccer career while studying to become an Applied Mathematician a la John Urschel who got his PhD while playing professional football! If this incredibly lofty dream does not pan out, working at the intersection of sports and mathematics would be an awesome alternative!
